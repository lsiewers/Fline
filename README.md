Fline is a **Mobile game**, where you follow the line with your finger. Slowly the line moves from the right to the left while the shape of the line changes and you may **never get the line to the left side**. Get new highscores and beat friends while playing on the same phone. Inspired by the wire loop game and endless runner apps like Flappy bird. *Also based on challenge and submission following the MDA framework*.

## How it works
The line moves to the left and the vertical line may not get to the left side of your screen. The vertical line can be stopped and dragged to the right when you drag your finger on the point where the horizontal line crosses the vertical line. 

### Modes
The game has 3 modes: singleplayer, 2-player and 3-player. You can challenge yourself by playing with multiple fingers or challenge your friends to play against them on the same phone.
